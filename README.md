# ESP32 Power Management Demonstration

This project demonstrates the power management capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller, showcasing transitions between **Run Mode**, **Light Sleep Mode**, and **Deep Sleep Mode**. The implementation is based on the ESP-IDF framework and uses a Wemos D1 R32 development board.

## Features

- **Run Mode**: Full CPU performance with active task execution.
- **Light Sleep Mode**: Reduced power consumption with RTC timer-based wake-ups.
- **Deep Sleep Mode**: Minimal power usage with timer-based wake-ups.
- **LED Indicators**: Visual feedback for mode transitions.

## Hardware Requirements

- Wemos D1 R32 (ESP32-based board)
- USB cable
- ESP-IDF development environment
